# Download tar file for SUNDIAL version BEFORE v7.0.0 and extract it at the same level as amrex.

# at the same level that amrex is cloned, do:

>> mkdir sundials
>> cd sundials
>> mkdir instdir
>> mkdir builddir
>> cd build

>> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/pathto/sundials/instdir \ 

> -DEXAMPLES_INSTALL_PATH=/pathto/sundials/instdir/examples \

>  ../../sundials-x.y.z # where x.y.z is the version of sundials

>> make -j4
>> make install

# in your .bashrc or preferred configuration file:

>> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/pathto/sundials/instdir/lib/

# now you are ready to compile MagneX with:

>> make -j4 USE_SUNDIALS=TRUE USE_TIME_INTEGRATOR=TRUE

# in your inputs file, you will need to have:

integration.type = SUNDIALS
integration.rk.type = # any number 1-4
integration.sundials.strategy = ERK # or SSPRK3

-------------------------------------------

inputs_compare

A domain of magnetic material initialized
so that My = Ms.  Exchange and demag are enabled.
To be compared to OpenBC_Conv.m.

-------------------------------------------

inputs_exchange

A block of magnetic material in the center of the domain initialized
so that My = Ms.  Only exchange physics is enabled, so the system does
not change due to the interface boundary conditions.

-------------------------------------------

inputs_PSSW

A block of magnetic material in the center of the domain initialized
so that My = Ms.  Exchange and demag are enabled.

-------------------------------------------

inputs_restart

This is the same as inputs_PSSW but with lower resolution and restart
hooks more easily enabled to test this capability with these physics.

-------------------------------------------

inputs_std4

Standard problem 4. Similar to inputs_PSSW with slightly different geometry
and material properties.
